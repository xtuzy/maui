    This double check seems excessive, but importing the WinUI.targets when building for windows is not
    sufficient. The WASDK targets assume everything is WinUI and thus just passes along the TFM of the app.
    As a result, if you have a net6.0 class library, the app will call MSBuild on that library - with the Windows TFM!
    This results in the $(TargetPlatformIdentifier) condition being met - even though there are no WASK targets to run!
